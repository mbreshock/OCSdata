Description: OCSdata is an R package to help you access and download case study data files 
 hosted on the OCS GitHub. The package provides several different functions to 
 enable users to grab the data they need at different sections in the case study, 
 as well as download the whole case study repository. All the user needs to do is 
 input the name of the case study being worked on. The package relies on the httr::GET() 
 function to access files through the GitHub API. The functions usethis::use_zip() 
 and usethis::create_from_github() are used to clone and/or download the case study 
 repositories.
