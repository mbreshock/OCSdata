## Inputs

### casestudy

All of the OCSdata functions require a case study ID to be input to the `casestudy` argument field. This ID should match with the case study you are intending to download data from. See the table below to see the case study names and their corresponding ID.

| Case Study Name | Case Study ID |  
| --------------- | ------------- |
| [Exploring global patterns of obesity across rural and urban regions](https://www.opencasestudies.org/ocs-bp-rural-and-urban-obesity/) | [ocs-bp-rural-and-urban-obesity](https://github.com/opencasestudies/ocs-bp-rural-and-urban-obesity) |

### outpath

All of the functions also have the option of specifying the path to the folder where the data should be downloaded to. This argument defaults to `NULL` which will download the files to your current working directory. `load_imported_data()` is the only function that does not have an `outpath` argument as this function only loads R objects into your global environment. 

### fork_repo

This is a logical argument and only used for `clone_ocs_repo()`. `FALSE` will clone the repo, while `TRUE` will fork the repo and then clone. Defaults to `NA` which will fork or clone based on your repository permissions. 

## How to Use

The following examples illustrate all of the different functions and how you can use them to stop and start at different sections of the case study. These assume you'd like to download the data files into your current working directory. If you'd like to download them elsewhere, specify the desired directory in the `outpath` argument. 

```R
library(OCSdata)

# Starting at data import section:
load_raw_data("ocs-bp-opioid-rural-urban", outpath = getwd())
# for file formats that are easier to import:
load_simpler_import("ocs-bp-opioid-rural-urban", outpath = getwd())

# Starting at data exploration/wrangling sections: 
load_imported_data("ocs-bp-opioid-rural-urban", outpath = getwd())

# Starting at data visualization/analysis sections:
load_wrangled_data("ocs-bp-opioid-rural-urban", outpath = getwd())

# Looking for more data on this topic: 
load_extra_data("ocs-bp-opioid-rural-urban", outpath = getwd())

# Download all repository files: 
load_repo("ocs-bp-opioid-rural-urban", outpath = getwd())

# Clone the case study GitHub repository: 
clone_ocs_repo("ocs-bp-opioid-rural-urban", outpath = getwd(), fork_repo = TRUE)

# Setting fork_repo = TRUE will fork the repo first and then clone the fork, 
# while FALSE will clone the repo directly from the Open Case Studies GitHub. 
# The default is fork_repo = NA, which will fork or clone based on your repository 
# permissions. This function requires your personal GitHub PAT to be registered in RStudio. 

```
*Note: The default argument for* `outpath` *will download the files to your current working directory.* `outpath = getwd()` *is redundant, but used here to illustrate that the download location can be specified.*

Just change "ocs-bp-opioid-rural-urban" to the ID of the case study you are working on!
